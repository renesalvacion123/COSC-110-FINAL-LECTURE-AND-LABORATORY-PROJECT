## Activities Overview

### **Activity 1: Defining and Displaying Expressions**
- **Description:** Introduction to defining symbolic variables and creating algebraic expressions using `symbols`, `expand`, and `simplify`.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `symbols()`: to define variables.
  - `expand()`: expands expressions like \((x + y)^2\).
  - `simplify()`: simplifies algebraic expressions.
- **Learning Outcome:** Understand how to construct and manipulate symbolic algebraic expressions.

---

###  **Activity 2: Solving Equations**
- **Description:** Solving single-variable and multi-variable algebraic equations.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `Eq()`: define equations.
  - `solve()`: solve equations symbolically.
- **Learning Outcome:** Ability to solve equations analytically and interpret symbolic results.

---

###  **Activity 3: Calculus Operations (Differentiation & Integration)**
- **Description:** Perform differentiation and integration on polynomial, trigonometric, and exponential expressions.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `diff()`: differentiate expressions.
  - `integrate()`: integrate expressions.
- **Learning Outcome:** Apply basic calculus operations in symbolic form.

---

###  **Activity 4: Limits and Series Expansion**
- **Description:** Evaluating limits and Taylor/Maclaurin series expansions.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `limit()`: calculate limits.
  - `series()`: expand functions into a power series.
- **Learning Outcome:** Use limits to evaluate functions at boundaries and understand series expansion for approximations.

---

###  **Activity 5: Plotting Functions**
- **Description:** Plot symbolic expressions using SymPyâ€™s plotting capabilities.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `plot()`: visualize symbolic functions.
- **Learning Outcome:** Visualize mathematical functions and their transformations.
