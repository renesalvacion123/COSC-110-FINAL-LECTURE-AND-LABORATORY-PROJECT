This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook for Lab 1, which focuses on analyzing and predicting survival outcomes from the Titanic dataset. The activity involves exploring the dataset, preprocessing the data, and applying basic machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.

## File(s) in this Folder:
- `lab1_titanic_Salvacion.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis, from data cleaning to model evaluation.

## Objectives:
- Understand the structure and variables in the Titanic dataset.
- Handle missing data and perform feature engineering.
- Apply classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression or Decision Trees.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and/or cross-validation.

## 📊 Dataset:
The dataset used is the **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). It includes features such as:
- Passenger class, name, sex, age, siblings/spouses aboard, parents/children aboard, and survival status.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
