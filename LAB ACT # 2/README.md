This folder contains the second lab activity focusing on deeper data analysis and improved predictive modeling using the Titanic dataset. The activity builds upon Lab 1 by refining preprocessing steps, experimenting with additional machine learning algorithms, and tuning model parameters for better accuracy.

## File(s) in this Folder:
- `lab2_titanic_Salvacion.ipynb` ‚Äì Jupyter Notebook featuring updated data handling, feature selection, and model evaluation processes.

## Objectives:
- Enhance previous data preprocessing strategies (e.g., better handling of missing values, encoding techniques).
- Implement and compare different classifiers such as:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Use techniques like grid search or cross-validation for model tuning.
- Evaluate models with confusion matrix, accuracy, and other metrics.

## Dataset:
Same as Lab 1: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## üöÄ How to Run:
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Open `lab2_titanic_Salvacion.ipynb` in Jupyter.
3. Install the required packages if not already:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
