## Overview

This repository contains solutions and demonstrations for **Lab 4: Introduction to SymPy**, a symbolic mathematics library in Python. The notebook (`lab4_sympy_Salvacion.ipynb`) includes activities that illustrate how to use SymPy for symbolic computation tasks such as equation solving, simplification, differentiation, integration, and plotting.

##  Activities Description

The notebook is divided into several core activities:

###  Activity 1: Symbolic Expressions
- Declaration of symbolic variables.
- Construction of algebraic expressions using SymPy.
- Basic symbolic operations (e.g., expansion, simplification, factoring).

###  Activity 2: Solving Equations
- Solving linear and quadratic equations using `solve()`.
- Using `Eq()` for symbolic equality.
- Demonstration of symbolic versus numerical solving.

###  Activity 3: Calculus with SymPy
- **Differentiation** using `diff()`.
- **Integration** using `integrate()`.
- Both definite and indefinite integrals are covered.

###  Activity 4: Plotting
- Plotting mathematical functions using SymPy's `plot()` utility.
- Understanding function visualization using symbolic expressions.

##  Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `sympy`
- `matplotlib` (optional, for plotting)
- `jupyter` (for running the notebook)

You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install sympy matplotlib notebook
